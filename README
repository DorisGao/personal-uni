= Usage
Feel free to use my work as outlined in the licences section below.

= Plagiarism
Most Universities and colleges now run plagiarism checkers on student
submissions to ensure the work is their own.
Rest assured, your tutors can use Google search just as well as you
can; if you've found my work and intend to just "copy paste" without
giving proper attribution, then YOU WILL PROBABLY GET CAUGHT.
If you do use my works in your submission, make sure it is correctly
attributed, referenced and commented/quoted as my work. Using other
peoples work WHEN PROPERLY ATTRIBUTED is the academic method.
